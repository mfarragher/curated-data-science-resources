# Python
## Analytics libraries
- Pandas: the core analytics library
- Numpy and Scipy: libraries for advanced mathematics and scientific computing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: core libraries for visualisations
- Statsmodels: main library for linear modelling and econometric methods.  My library Appelpy is a wrapper around it which is focused more on model diagnostics.  Linearmodels has advanced techniques for statisticians and econometricians.

## Pandas & plotting
### Starting off
- 📽 [DataSchool.io](https://www.dataschool.io/start/): range of video tutorials for learning Pandas.  A lot of free material.
- 📘 Master Data Analysis with Python: Ted Petrou's neat introduction to learning Pandas with practical examples.  Author knows the mechanics of the library very well.  Even with a few years of Pandas usage I learnt a few new recipes from the book.
- 📁 [Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://github.com/tdpetrou/Minimally-Sufficient-Pandas): also by Petrou, this repo is a handy resource for narrowing down the functionality of Pandas to a few dozen methods and general good practice.
- 📃 [Pandas: the two cultures](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-the-two-cultures.html): why does Pandas have so many methods in the API for doing the same thing?  A lot of that is due to how the library caters for two 'cultures' of users: i) statisticians; ii) machine learning practitioners.  This post by Pandas maintainer Marc Garcia is a spotlight on the cultures.
- 🕸 [Practical Business Python](https://pbpython.com/): blog with many applications of Pandas and the visualisation libraries for business problems.
- [Real Python's Matplotlib Guide](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide): Matplotlib documentation can be daunting for beginners.  This guide is a nice overview of the Matplotlib interface.

### Augmenting knowledge
- 📃 [Diving into Pandas is faster than reinventing it](http://deanla.com/dont_reinvent_pandas.html): examples that show the power of method chaining.
