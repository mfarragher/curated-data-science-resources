# Inspiration
- 📁 [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/): excellent template to use as a structure for a data science project.  With enough use of this approach it's also inspired my thinking on how to structure a 'mono repo' that contains multiple data science projects in one codebase.
- 📁 [clean-code-ml](https://github.com/davified/clean-code-ml): examples of how prototype model code on the Titanic dataset can be refactored and moved into source code.
- 📘 [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/): an online handbook by the Alan Turing Institute for best practice on reproducible data science.  The audience is more for academic researchers, e.g. many of the chapters focus on topics like version control, testing, etc.  There are some useful techniques and tools covered to help data scientists make analysis reproducible, from the old (e.g. Make) to the new (e.g. Binder).
- 📃 [Coding habits for data scientists](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists): blog post from Thoughtworks with tips on how to manage complexity in data science projects and do frequent refactoring of code.

# Notebook tips
- 📃 [Google Cloud's Jupyter Notebook Manifesto](https://cloudblog.withgoogle.com/products/ai-machine-learning/best-practices-that-can-improve-the-life-of-any-developer-using-jupyter-notebooks/amp/): eight principles for developing with Jupyter Notebooks.
