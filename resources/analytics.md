# Python
## Analytics libraries
- Pandas: the core analytics library
- Numpy and Scipy: libraries for advanced mathematics and scientific computing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: core libraries for visualisations
- Statsmodels: main library for linear modelling and econometric methods.  My library Appelpy is a wrapper around it which is focused more on model diagnostics.  Linearmodels has advanced techniques for statisticians and econometricians.

## Pandas & plotting
### Starting off
- 📽 [DataSchool.io](https://www.dataschool.io/start/): range of video tutorials for learning Pandas.  A lot of free material.
  - 📽 _[Data analysis in Python with Pandas](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos)_: Some of the free video tutorials in a playlist for beginners.
- 📘 Master Data Analysis with Python: Ted Petrou's neat introduction to learning Pandas with practical examples.  Author knows the mechanics of the library very well.  Even with a few years of Pandas usage I learnt a few new recipes from the book.
- 📁 [Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://github.com/tdpetrou/Minimally-Sufficient-Pandas): also by Petrou, this repo is a handy resource for narrowing down the functionality of Pandas to a few dozen methods and general good practice.
- 📃 [Pandas: the two cultures](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-the-two-cultures.html): why does Pandas have so many methods in the API for doing the same thing?  A lot of that is due to how the library caters for two 'cultures' of users: i) statisticians; ii) machine learning practitioners.  This post by Pandas maintainer Marc Garcia is a spotlight on the cultures.
- 🕸 [Practical Business Python](https://pbpython.com/): blog with many applications of Pandas and the visualisation libraries for business problems.
- 📃 [Real Python's Matplotlib Guide](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide): Matplotlib documentation can be daunting for beginners.  This guide is a nice overview of the Matplotlib interface.

### Augmenting knowledge
- 📃 [Diving into Pandas is faster than reinventing it](http://deanla.com/dont_reinvent_pandas.html): examples that show the power of method chaining.
- 📁 [Chris Albon's data wrangling posts](https://chrisalbon.com/#python)
- 📃 [Wes McKinney | Apache Arrow and the "10 Things I Hate About pandas"](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/): learnings from Wes McKinney on his time spent developing Pandas.  The post touches upon the early history of Pandas and how the library wasn't developed with large datasets in mind (e.g. 100+ GB size).  It was written in 2017 and there's been immense progress since then with libraries that can do sophisticated parallel computing on large datasets.
- 🕸 [Tom Augspurger's blog](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/archives/), in particular the series of posts on 'modern idiomatic Pandas', e.g. [time series](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/modern-7-timeseries/).
