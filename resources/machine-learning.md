# Intro
- 📘 [The Hundred-page Machine Learning Book](http://themlbook.com/): Andriy Burkov's book is a great introduction to machine learning techniques.  The book is available on 'read first, buy later' principle.
- 🕸 [R2D3](http://www.r2d3.us/): visual introduction to the variance–bias trade-off and decision trees.
- 🕸 [Tensorflow's Neural Network Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/): interactive introduction to neural networks.  See the effects of changes to network architecture and hyperparameters on model results.

# General
- 🕸 [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/): range of tutorials and blog posts, from beginner to advanced concepts.  Blog is regularly updated.
- 🎙 [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/)
- 🎙 [Lex Fridman's AI Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/ai/)

# Advanced references
- 📘 [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/): Hastie and Tibshirani textbook with applications in R.  Online book is offered free.  Authors Hastie and Tibshirani have over 15 hours of [lecture videos](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/) on YouTube to supplement the book.
- 📘 [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/): Hastie and Tibshirani textbook on statistical learning.  More advanced than their ISL textbook - assumes much more of an undergraduate-level knowledge of linear algebra, calculus and statistics.
- 📘 [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/)
