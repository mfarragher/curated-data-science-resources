# Causal inference
## Introduction
- 📘 [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/): Judea Pearl's most recent book on causal inference.  The book explores the historical background of causal inference and Pearl's mathematical calculus for causal reasoning.
- 📽 [On the path to causal inference](https://pyvideo.org/pydata-london-2019/on-the-path-to-causal-inference.html) my primer on causal inference, which explores an application of causal inference to conversion rate modelling on hotel websites (no mathematics involved).  It is an application of Pearl's causal toolkit, but I also relate it to my experience with econometric methods and try to decompose the relationships in diagrams in ways that helped me to understand the toolkit.
- 🕸 [Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations): neat website for showing how correlation plots can show strong but absurd correlations between variables.  Notice also how they are prevalent with time series data, which are prone to having a trend (what would be called a non-stationary process in econometrics).

## Econometric methods
Econometric methods are often used to discern causal relationships in systems that involve economic variables.
