# Biases
## Cognitive biases
Many cognitive biases are examples of statistical bias.  These are some cognitive biases that can be problematic when producing (and consuming) research or data analysis.
- **Confirmation bias**:
    - Tendency to search for information / data in support of one's prior beliefs, at the detriment of other relevant evidence.
    - It can be more tempting to try to 'confirm' a hypothesis than to 'disprove' a hypothesis.
    - 📃 [The curious case of confirmation bias](www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/seeing-what-others-dont/201905/the-curious-case-confirmation-bias): article examines common claims about the prevalence of the bias and discusses how the concept has shifted to cover multiple tendencies over time (e.g. recall only of evidence that supports prior beliefs).
- **Survivorship bias**:
    - Fallacy of focusing on data points that pass a criterion of success, at the detriment of data points that are less visible due to their failure.
    - Business & finance are common examples of domains where the bias is prominent.
    - 📽 [You are missing something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyLVIvBidIA): 5-minute summary with practical examples of 'survivors' and how decision-making can be adversely affected by the bias.
    - 📃 [How the survivor bias distorts reality](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-survivor-bias-distorts-reality/): short article mentions examples of the bias from a few different sources.
- **Publication bias**
- **Insensitivity to sample size**
