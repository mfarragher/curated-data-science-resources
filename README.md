# curated-data-science-resources
 People have asked me about data science resources so I've curated some

This isn't an 'awesome' list... it will always be much shorter than that.  It's more a curation of reference material, which I think would have a broad audience.

This is a work in progress.

Aspects covered (more to come):
- Analytics
- Approaching projects
