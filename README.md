# curated-data-science-resources
 People have asked me about data science resources so I've curated some

This isn't an 'awesome' list... it will always be much shorter than that.  It's more a curation of reference material, which I think would have a broad audience.

ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. ðŸš§

Aspects covered (incl. more to come):
- [Analytics](resources/analytics.md)
- [Approaching projects](resources/approaching-projects.md)
- [Statistics](resources/statistics.md)
- [Machine learning](resources/machine-learning.md)
- Python development
